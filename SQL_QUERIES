# Looking at Crime

Union both tables into one new table. Had to separate the initial CSV file to upload to BigQuery, 
as the file was too large. Now, I can recombine and reivew as one table. I verified early on that the columns all matched.
Saved results as `crime_combined`

```
SELECT *
FROM `lapd-data.arrests_and_crime_reports_2020_present.crime_2020_present_1`

UNION ALL

SELECT * 
FROM `lapd-data.arrests_and_crime_reports_2020_present.crime_2020_present_2`
```


# Are `DR_NO` values unique? 
YES - all values are unique. Tallied total records for both tables & matched w/ results.

```
SELECT DISTINCT DR_NO
FROM (
  SELECT DR_NO FROM `lapd-data.arrests_and_crime_reports_2020_present.crime_2020_present_2`
  UNION ALL

```
```
SELECT DISTINCT DR_NO
FROM `lapd-data.arrests_and_crime_reports_2020_present.crime_combined`

# Do the `DR_NO` and `Report_IDs` match from the data provided?
No results

### Distinct crm descriptions (crime 2020): 
```
SELECT DISTINCT Crm_Cd_Desc
FROM `lapd-data.arrests_and_crime_reports_2020_present.crime_combined`
```
Results: 138


Added a new calculated column `reporting_timeframe` to find the difference between when 
an incident occurred vs how long after it was reported

```
ALTER TABLE `lapd-data.arrests_and_crime_reports_2020_present.crime_combined`
ADD COLUMN `reporting_timeframe` INTEGER;

ALTER TABLE `lapd-data.arrests_and_crime_reports_2020_present.crime_combined`
ALTER COLUMN reporting_timeframe SET DATA TYPE NUMERIC;

UPDATE `lapd-data.arrests_and_crime_reports_2020_present.crime_combined`
SET reporting_timeframe = date_diff(Date_Rptd, DATE_OCC, DAY)
WHERE TRUE

```

Functional Analysis of reporting timeframes that may be able to be matched against other columns.

SELECT MIN(reporting_timeframe)
FROM `lapd-data.arrests_and_crime_reports_2020_present.crime_combined`

Result: 0

SELECT MAX(reporting_timeframe)
FROM `lapd-data.arrests_and_crime_reports_2020_present.crime_combined`

Result: 1172

SELECT AVG(reporting_timeframe)
FROM `lapd-data.arrests_and_crime_reports_2020_present.crime_combined`

Result: 9.673277625

To get the MODE (most frequently occuring #)

SELECT reporting_timeframe, COUNT(1) AS frequency
FROM `lapd-data.arrests_and_crime_reports_2020_present.crime_combined`
WHERE reporting_timeframe IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY reporting_timeframe
ORDER BY frequency DESC 

Result: 0 day (same day) reporting @ 339905 instances.
~50% of the time it's reported same day, ~21% reported within 1 day


Saved table and CSV file for future reference, if needed.

Added a new column to the table as INTEGER at first (oops), so changed to Numeric.
Set the value to be the date diff between date reported and date occurred. Confirmed
the output matched what I saw in Google Sheets.

Saved the new CSV file for further analysis in Tableau.
